# **CP3402 Project Report**
## **Introduction**
Over the course of 2 weeks, I developed a website for University of The Third Age (U3A), aiming to increase attendees to their classes, and to have a resource for information about U3A. From this experience I am now well versed in website development and operating content management systems. I highlight below the skills I have gained which are both IT specific and transferrable across several different roles in different industries. Aside from honing my broadening skillset, I gained useful know how for a number of different tools and technologies which are widely used in the industry.

## **Objectives**
The main objective of the project was to design, code and deploy a dynamic website, that allowed for senior users (usually people over 50 years of age) to discover classes, sign up as a member, and see the schedule of classes (to attend in-person). Users can also view an array of photos under the photo galley along with a collection of newsletters that can be updated by the site administrator. The website is designed to be user-friendly and simple so that people who are not as familiar with electronic devices can easily operate it to suit their needs.

## **Tools Used**
Developing the website for ‘University for the Third Age’ required a selection of coding languages, software, and other technologies to allow myself to manage, develop and host the website:
 - Front-end Development:
   - HTML: A markup language, used to structure the website’s content;
   - CSS: A stylesheet language, utilised to design and define the style of an overall website;
   - PHP: A scripting language, used to create scripts to allow for dynamic webpages, and dynamic applications;
 - Back-end Development:
   - Vagrant: A tool used to build and host a Virtual Machine environment, specifically to host WordPress;
   - YAML: A data serialisation language, that dictates and assists with the transfer of data from the local environment to the deployment environment;
 - Version Control and Collaboration:
   - Git:  A Version Control system, that tracks changes made to a local repository, and can be used to upload all changes to a repository, for when you want to have a de-centralised workspace that’s saved to the cloud, and allows for access anywhere;
   - GitHub: A cloud-based platform that stores a centralised repository, allowing for a single workspace between multiple environments – for example where the one program is being edited by several developers;
   - Trello: A web-based collaboration tool, that allows for the organisation of tasks and projects into “boards”; and
 - Deployment:
   - DigitalOcean: A cloud computing vendor that offers Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platform which, (in this instance, is utilised to host WordPress on an Ubuntu server.

## **Skills Developed**
### **Workflow Automation**
This required an approach from an open mindset. In order to link up my local environment to the production environment via GitHub and make the code in deploy.yaml function accurately, I needed to have the.yaml file catch when a “push” was done to the Repository, then execute a line of code (via SSH) to the Production environment, where it’d then execute a pull request from the Repo. When I was trying to link up my local environment to the production environment, via GitHub, I struggled to make the code in the .yaml function correctly. This allowed me to make a workflow code that pushes all updated code to the published repository. Conducting this research allowed me to find a solution faster than it would’ve taken to solve independently. From this, I displayed skills of problem solving, efficient time management, and tenacity.

### **Testing/Analysis**
Throughout the project, I conducted testing on the site to assess for, identify and resolve potential issues. This included using the “Inspect Element” that is offered with all browsers to rectify issues or design flaws with the website. Hence, I demonstrated strong attention to detail  and a high skill level to both write HTML/CSS/PHP code and understand it.

### **Project Management**
I utilised timelines, milestones, and a task board to organise my project, demonstrating an exemplary level of time management and organisation.

## **Conclusion**
My application of a broad range of skills resulted in the development of a structured, well-planned, and accessible website providing the opportunities to demonstrate my technical expertise in front-end development, back-end development, version control, and website hosting. Furthermore, it allowed me to brainstorm and apply techniques and design features that allow for the accessibility for the demographic of users that are both unfamiliar with Information Technology, and/or may suffer from various impairments.
